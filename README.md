If you have a question, an idea or some feedback unrelated to the specification, please visit the [community site](https://plus.google.com/communities/106455663981908394819).

Currently there are 2 main branches:

* [v1](https://github.com/open-education-api/specification/tree/v1) (Current version - final)
* [v2](https://github.com/open-education-api/specification/tree/v2) (Future version - draft)

## Roadmap

These activities are planned for the next period:

* Discuss & process feedback v1 (should be backwards-compatible)
* Discuss & process additions and improvements in separate v2 branch

## Documentation

The specification can be rendered as HTML documentation:

* [API Reference Documentation](https://rawgit.com/open-education-api/specification/v2/docs.html)

## Development

To render the reference documentation locally during development, you can start a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition/) container:

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -v ${PWD}:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:alpine
```

Now you can view the docs in your web browser: http://localhost:8080/docs.html
